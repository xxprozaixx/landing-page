                <h4>Tsundere</h4>
                <p>If you’ve ever heard ‘it’s not like I gave this [insert item here] to you, baka’ or “it’s not like I was worried about you” with a pouty face, then you’re probably familiar with the Tsundere. They’re a person who’s cold and hostile on the outside, but sweet and kind on the inside with the right people. It’s possibly the most recognizable Dere type that originated from a character named Ayu Daikuuji from the visual novel Kima ga Nozomu Eien. </p>

                <h4>Deredere</h4>
                <p>What if someone with a Deredere personality suddenly takes a dark turn? That’s basically who the Yandere is. At first, they’re really affectionate and loving towards their significant other until it becomes a constant obsession for them. This leads the Yandere to become overprotective, violent, and psychotic towards those they deem a threat to the happiness and wellbeing of their partner. If they feel slighted, they may also harm their beloved in order to protect themselves. </p>

                <h4>Dandere</h4>
                <p>Dandere are usually shy, quiet, and asocial people in most situations. They tend to stay quiet to avoid getting into conflict. Despite their reserved nature, these introverts will open up and show their Dere side when they’re alone with the right person or group. </p>

                </div>
                <h4>Kuudere</h4>
                <p>The Kuudere always plays it cool as the name suggests. Even in the most stressful situations, they’re always calm and collected. They never panic and often remain distant and analytical to the end. Unlike the Dandere, they rarely display any affection or emotion to others in any situation, but may be hiding their true emotions deep down. </p>
