### Objective
This project will focus on making a basic website from scratch using what I learned from the Odin Project. Following some of the basic layour that is provided by TOP.

### Self-Reflection
Overall took around a few hours to complete, the final result is ok. But I think there are a lot of much better ways to handle the layout. I felt like I type a lot of redundant things.
